# InstaLikeFragmentTransaction
Easy Bottom Tab Navigation with back stack history


InstaLikeFragmentTransaction is an\ open source repository with custom Bottom tab Fragment backstack transaction and stack history for Tabs.

What inspired me to write this post ?

The reason is “Instagram”. I love to play with Insta app since it is easy, robust and less screen navigation, which in turn collectively bottom tab navigation took the peek place in the Android community.


Why TabLayout instead of Design support BottomNavigationView?

I have plenty of reasons for the same as below:
It’s not flexible.
Random behaviour if there are less tab items.
Customising text sizes and icon sizes are like a nightmare (Just try adding small sized icon for one tab and big sized icon for the other ;-) ).
